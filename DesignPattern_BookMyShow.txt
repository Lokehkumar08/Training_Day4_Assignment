1. User Authentication
Singletion : We only need one instance of the session manager 
that tracks user sessions during the app's lifecycle.

Factory: For creating different types of authentication methods 
(ex : social login, password-based login)

2. Movie/Event Search
Composite: where movies and events are grouped under various categories (ex : genre, city, language).

3. Seat Selection
Command: Selecting seats and booking tickets can be encapsulated as Command objects, 
which represent the various actions (selecting a seat, canceling a booking, updating booking).

4. Payment Process
Strategy: The payment gateway (ex: credit card, PayPal, UPI, wallet) 
can be selected dynamically through the Strategy pattern.

5. Notifying / Order Confirmation
Observer: Once the payment is successful, the system uses the Observer pattern to notify different modules 
(ex: user account, booking history) that the transaction was successful.
